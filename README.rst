Dynamic forms for Django

**dj-dynamic-forms** lets you create your forms through the Django
admin. You can add and remove form fields as you need them. That makes
it perfect for creating survey or application forms.

It uses ``Postgres Hstore`` extension to store forms data.

This project is fork of
`django-dynamic-forms <https://github.com/Markush2010/django-dynamic-forms>`__
by `Markush2010 <https://github.com/Markush2010>`__ mainly to use
Postgres Hstore by default.

Install
-------

::

    1. pip install -r requirements.txt
    2. pip install dj-dynamic-forms

Postgres extension ``Hstore`` must be installed manually.

::

    CREATE EXTENSION Hstore;

Usage
-----

Add ``'dynamic_forms'`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'dynamic_forms',
        ...
    )

Add ``'dynamic_forms.middlewares.FormModelMiddleware'`` to the
``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` (probably at the end)::

::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'dynamic_forms.middlewares.FormModelMiddleware'
    )

You can set ``DYNAMIC_FORMS_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`` in your settings to a
list of e-mail addresses. Forms being send via e-mail will then be send
to those addresses instead of those defined in ``settings.ADMINS``. Each
recipient will see *all* other recipients. See
`send\_mail <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mail>`__
in the officiall documentation.

Example
-------

1. Change into the ``example/`` directory
2. Run ``./manage.py runserver``

The *admin* is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.

-  Username: ``admin``
-  Password: ``password``

You can find an example form at http://127.0.0.1:8000/example-form/.

Running the tests
-----------------

1. Change into the ``tests/`` directory
